;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "29.1") (etaf-gamekit "0.1.0") (etaf-ui "0.1.0"))
;;; Commentary:
;; Chu He presents OpenSpiel's xiangqi rules on a native ETAF board with both
;; palettes and a computer opponent. Graphical displays use vector
;; intersections and circular stones; terminals keep text cells. Artwork,
;; selection and move hints are presentation only; legality and history stay
;; in OpenSpiel, and its adapter supplies the opponent's search.
;;
;; Variable: etaf-xiangqi-game
;; Inert game definition usable with etaf-gamekit-start. Each instance owns an
;; independent match with red moving first. Override :seed in GameKit options
;; for a reproducible opening.
;;
;; Variable: etaf-xiangqi-appearance
;; Initial appearance for new instances: auto (default), light or dark. Auto
;; follows the opening frame's background mode. Each instance can switch
;; independently with the theme button or T without resetting the match.
;;
;; Variable: etaf-xiangqi-opponent
;; Who plays which side in new instances: computer-black (the default, with the
;; human on red), computer-red or hot-seat. The application dialog switches a
;; running match with O; the computer moves when it is its turn and the backend
;; advertises the bot operation. A reply leaves at least 0.6 seconds of reading
;; time, then uses a scoped ETAF transition on graphical boards. The last move's
;; endpoints and caption remain visible. Disabling etaf-animation-enabled keeps
;; the reading interval and static feedback without interpolated movement.
;;
;; Variable: etaf-xiangqi-level
;; Strength of the computer opponent in new instances: easy, normal (default)
;; or hard. Each level selects the search's plies and seconds per move; the
;; dialog changes it for a running match.
;;
;; Function: etaf-xiangqi-create (&optional seed)
;;;###autoload (autoload 'etaf-xiangqi-create "etaf-xiangqi" nil t)
;; Create and return an independent GameKit session without displaying it.
;; SEED is an optional integer; omitted creates a fresh random opening. The
;; caller owns display and lifecycle; pass the result to etaf-xiangqi-view and
;; release it with etaf-gamekit-close.
;;
;; Function: etaf-xiangqi-view (session)
;;;###autoload (autoload 'etaf-xiangqi-view "etaf-xiangqi" nil t)
;; Return the reactive View for SESSION, suitable for embedding in a host such
;; as an etaf-desktop window. The caller owns SESSION's display and lifecycle.
;;
;; Function: etaf-xiangqi-open (&optional seed)
;;;###autoload (autoload 'etaf-xiangqi-open "etaf-xiangqi" nil t)
;; Open and display an independent match; return its GameKit instance. SEED is
;; an optional integer. The opponent follows etaf-xiangqi-opponent: the
;; computer replies by itself, or both sides are played hot-seat in one buffer,
;; where the bridge view switches to the side to move after every move.
;; Requires the OpenSpiel runtime installed by GameKit. No snapshot is loaded
;; implicitly.
;;
;; Function: etaf-xiangqi-close (&optional instance)
;;;###autoload (autoload 'etaf-xiangqi-close "etaf-xiangqi" nil t)
;; Close INSTANCE and its buffer. Omitted uses the current Xiangqi buffer.
;; No automatic save is performed; use the application's Save command first.
;; Closing also cancels pending reply presentation and its animation scope.
